ReplayLatestByClass
===================

`ReplayLatestByClass` is an RxJava 2 transformer which combines a custom version of `replay`, `publish()` and `autoConnect()`.

The version of replay of this transformer replays the latest elements of a certain class type to each new subscriber. The order of the elements emitted at subscribtion is not preserved.

Apply with `compose` to an upstream `Observable` or `Flowable`.
This operator will *not* unsubscribe from upstream opeartors even if the number of subscirptions drops to 0.
